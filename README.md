Hello All! Welcome to Project GA: Visualizing Forensic Data in OSINT 
Knowledge Graphs!!

## Our Goal
Our goal is to develop a series of visualization examples that can be 
stand-alone, organized into a workflow, or establish how stand-alone 
visualizations might be used in research/analytic workflows for policy related 
decisions. We are focusing on a Responsible AI use-case, using public data from 
the Artificial Intelligence Incident Database (AIID). The AIID contains a corpus 
of news reports regarding incidents involving AI that result in societal harm, 
broadly defined. We spent some time performing an exploratory analysis on the 
data in AIID and creating visualizations to graph those analyses. We synthesized 
and created a flow chart describing the workflow of analysts to better help us 
make our visualizations. Incorporating that information, we developed possible 
use cases that might be presented to an analyst, and created visualizations that 
would assist analysts in their endeavors to answer the questions presented. 
This is a timely challenge for policy makers in understanding how AI should be 
governed within supply chain, utilities, media, and governments themselves. AI 
is a new and emerging technology that has lots of potential, and thus should be 
regulated to maintain safety. 

## Repo Data and How To Get Fresh Datasets
That being said, this repo will mainly hold spreadsheets and scripts used to
help us achieve our goal. All of our data was from AIID. The info for how to 
get the data fresh from AIID, and how to extract it into your directory 
can be found in the extracting_tar_bz2_files.py file.

## Repo FYI & How to Run
Other than that, this repo also has all the spreadsheets and files needed to 
run the visualizations we have created. To avoid confusion, the spreadsheet 
files and the program files are titles very similairly. Just download both files
into the same directory and it should run (hopefully).

## Spreadsheet Naming Convention
In the name of the spreadsheets, you will see a date. That date corresponds to 
the AIID snapshot that was used to make the visualization.
